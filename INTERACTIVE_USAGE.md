# Interactive Mortgage Calculator Usage

## Overview
The mortgage calculator now supports two modes:
1. **Sample Data Mode**: Uses predefined rates from `data/sample_loans.json`
2. **Interactive Mode**: Allows you to input your own mortgage rates and terms

## How to Use

### Option 1: Run the Enhanced Main Script
```bash
python3 run_with_sample_data.py
```

When prompted, choose:
- **1** for sample data (predefined rates)
- **2** for custom input (your own rates)

### Option 2: Run the Dedicated Interactive Script
```bash
python3 interactive_mortgage_input.py
```

This script goes directly to the interactive input mode.

## Interactive Input Process

When you choose the interactive mode, you'll be prompted to enter:

1. **Loan Amount (Principal)**: The total amount you want to borrow
2. **Number of Options**: How many different mortgage options you want to compare (1-5)
3. **For Each Option**:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "30-Year Fixed", "15-Year ARM")
   - **Interest Rate**: Annual rate as a percentage (e.g., 6.5 for 6.5%)
   - **Loan Term**: Number of years (e.g., 30, 15, 20)
